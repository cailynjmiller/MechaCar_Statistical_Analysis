## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variables/coefficients vehicle_length, ground_clearance, and the incercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the this linear model. You can tell this by looking at the Pr(>|t|) value.
- The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero. Because the p-value (5.35e-11) is less than 0.05, then we reject the null Hypothesis that the slope of the linear regression is zero assuming significance level of 0.05%.
- This linear model helps predict the mpg effecively. The r^2 value is 0.7149, which means that this model can can help predict the mpg 71.49% of the time.
